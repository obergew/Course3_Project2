The original dataset and descriptions can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

This dataset compiles the activity measurements (X) with their descriptions and subjects measured.

Column label: Subject
Variable type: Numeric
Values: 1-30

The remaining columns are mean and standard deviation of various signals best described by the original dataset codebook.  
>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
>'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

>Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
