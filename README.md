The project was inspired by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Reyes-Ortiz et al. 2012). The details of the experiment can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The purpose of the script found in the project is to compile and clean the data.

The repository includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'code_book.md': Shows information about the variables.

- 'run_analysis.R': This is the script written for the class project

Notes: 
======
- The data must be in your working directory for the script to work.
- The script requires package dplyr.
